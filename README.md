1. React Basics:
JSX (JavaScript XML):

Explanation: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React. It looks similar to XML/HTML and is used with React to describe what the UI should look like.
Functional Components and Hooks:

Explanation: React components can be functional or class-based. In this project, functional components are used, and useState and useEffect are hooks that manage state and side effects in functional components.
2. React Router:
BrowserRouter, Route, and Routes:

Explanation: React Router is used for navigation in a React application. BrowserRouter is the router component that uses HTML5 history API. Route is used to declare routes, and Routes is a container for multiple Route components.
Route Parameters (:movieId):

Explanation: Parameters in routes are used to capture dynamic values from the URL. In this project, :movieId is a route parameter used in the path to identify a specific movie.
3. API Integration:
Axios for HTTP Requests:
Explanation: Axios is a library used for making HTTP requests. In this project, it's used to fetch data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.
4. State Management:
useState and useEffect Hooks:
Explanation: useState is used to declare state variables in functional components, and useEffect is used to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching.
5. Project Structure:
Folder Structure (src/components, api.js):
Explanation: Organizing your project into folders like components and api helps maintain a clean and modular structure. api.js contains functions for interacting with the TMDb API.
6. Conditional Rendering:
Conditional Rendering in MovieDetail.js:
Explanation: The if (!movie) statement in MovieDetail.js checks whether the movie data has been fetched. If not, it displays a loading message.
7. Error Handling:
Try-Catch Blocks in API Requests:
Explanation: The try-catch blocks in the API functions (getPopularMovies and getMovieDetails) handle errors during the HTTP requests. If an error occurs, it's logged to the console.
8. React-Router Version 6:
Routes instead of Switch:
Explanation: React Router version 6 introduces the Routes component as a replacement for the previous Switch component. It provides a more declarative way to define routes.
